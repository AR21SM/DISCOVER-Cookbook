### Event Registration

What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

Preparing to meet accessibility needs

- Outline any accessibility services you plan to provide on the registration form. Then:
- üçé Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
  - &quot;Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please email [contact@myconference.com](mailto:contact@myconference.com) and include the details of your request.&quot;
- Provide any deadlines for requests (it can be difficult to arrange sign-language translation at the last minute, for example).

Supporting Attendance through Grants

- &quot;Would you be interested in a grant to cover childcare OR on-site childcare services? (Which would be most beneficial?)&quot;

Dietary Restrictions

- üçé Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.
- Use an open text box to ask about dietary restrictions.
  - &quot;Do you have any dietary restrictions we should be aware of? (e.g. allergies)&quot;

Photo Policy

- üçé If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out.
  - (see lanyard photo explanation under Inclusive Practices)

Code of Conduct

- üçé Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

T-Shirts

- If you plan to offer t-shirts, consider offering more than one cut/fit of shirt.
- Provide shirt sizing information with the registration form where you ask for shirt size. (Provide a wide range of sizes, including plus-size.)
- Describe the cut in gender-neutral terms (e.g. &quot;fitted&quot; vs. &quot;straight-cut&quot;) with photo examples, rather than using gender-loaded terms (&quot;men&#39;s,&quot; &quot;women&#39;s,&quot; &quot;unisex&quot;).

Demographic Info

- **Why do you need it?**
  - We recommend you do not ask for information just &quot;out of curiosity&quot; but rather that there are **planned actions you will take depending on the results** of your survey.
  - If just for purposes of &quot;counting&quot; or ascertaining the diversity of your conference, we suggest doing this in the form of an anonymous post-survey instead.
- If you absolutely must include demographic info in your registration form, **make it optional, not required**. Forcing people to identify themselves by demographic category is not an inclusive practice and may prompt stereotype threat.
- ‚úÖ If you do collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the questions so that they are inclusive and don&#39;t contribute to alienating or &quot;othering&quot; marginalized people.
  - Not having an answer choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
- ‚úÖ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for limiting access to this information and keeping it secure.

Inclusive practices during check-in

Pronouns

- üçé Via SRCCON: &quot;When you register, you can choose a badge lanyard indicating your photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) and a pin for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don&#39;t feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for the colleagues who do (and please respect other people&#39;s pronouns).&quot;
- &quot;One thing I&#39;d like to try next are pins+hack your own. the pins are also color coordinated, they&#39;re there to set a norm and officially sanction them. it lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color! + choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness) and means that needing to actually read is a stress case rather than the norm. and because people are used to the ease of normal case, they&#39;re more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)&quot; ~Cordelia Yu
- To be aware of: &quot;pins were also tiny (1/2 inch circles) with 60% taken up by the words &quot;pronouns&quot; and spacing.&quot;

Welcoming New Attendees

- Additional ribbons can be useful, e.g. &quot;First-Time Attendee.&quot; Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- Run a mentoring program

Social Events

- &quot;First-Time Attendee&quot; lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
- Host post-official-agenda receptions
- Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
  - Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
- Alcohol Considerations

- We recommend the AdaCamp Toolkit&#39;s summary approach to alcohol at events: [https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)

Special Considerations Depending on Geographic Context

E.g. very remote location with no public transit

U.S.-specific information vs. other countries (e.g. ADA protections)

 States with discriminatory laws (Needs info)
