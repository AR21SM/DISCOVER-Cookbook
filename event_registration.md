### Event Registration

What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

Preparing to meet accessibility needs

- Outline any accessibility services you plan to provide on the registration form. Then:
- üçé Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
  - &quot;Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please email [contact@myconference.com](mailto:contact@myconference.com) and include the details of your request.&quot;
- Provide any deadlines for requests (it can be difficult to arrange sign-language translation at the last minute, for example).

Supporting Attendance through Grants

- &quot;Would you be interested in a grant to cover childcare OR on-site childcare services? (Which would be most beneficial?)&quot;

Dietary Restrictions

- üçé Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.
- Use an open text box to ask about dietary restrictions.
  - &quot;Do you have any dietary restrictions we should be aware of? (e.g. allergies)&quot;

Photo Policy

- üçé If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out.
  - (see lanyard photo explanation under Inclusive Practices)

Code of Conduct

- üçé Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

T-Shirts

- If you plan to offer t-shirts, consider offering more than one cut/fit of shirt.
- Provide shirt sizing information with the registration form where you ask for shirt size. (Provide a wide range of sizes, including plus-size.)
- Describe the cut in gender-neutral terms (e.g. &quot;fitted&quot; vs. &quot;straight-cut&quot;) with photo examples, rather than using gender-loaded terms (&quot;men&#39;s,&quot; &quot;women&#39;s,&quot; &quot;unisex&quot;).

Demographic Info

- **Why do you need it?**
  - We recommend you do not ask for information just &quot;out of curiosity&quot; but rather that there are **planned actions you will take depending on the results** of your survey.
  - If just for purposes of &quot;counting&quot; or ascertaining the diversity of your conference, we suggest doing this in the form of an anonymous post-survey instead.
- If you absolutely must include demographic info in your registration form, **make it optional, not required**. Forcing people to identify themselves by demographic category is not an inclusive practice and may prompt stereotype threat.
- ‚úÖ If you do collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the questions so that they are inclusive and don&#39;t contribute to alienating or &quot;othering&quot; marginalized people.
  - Not having an answer choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
- ‚úÖ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for limiting access to this information and keeping it secure.
