# Minimal Set of measures

## Venue Selection & On-Site Services

### Accessibility Considerations

-   Consider attendees who may need accommodations for a disability
    

####  Mobility

-   üçé Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair, crutches, cane, etc.). Choose easily-accessible seats, such as at the end of a row on the aisle.
    
-   üçé Create wide aisles between chairs to make it easier for people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the room.
    

#### Disability

-   üçé Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps. Ask conference organizers to announce important information over the microphone, which helps people with impaired vision.

- ‚úÖ Book sign-language interpreters and/or real-time captioning (someone typing captions) for deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees.**
    

### Bathrooms

#### Gender-Neutral Bathrooms

-   üçé Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing what to do if you think someone is in the "wrong" restroom
    

	-   "If you think someone's gender doesn't match the sign on the door, please follow these steps: Don't worry about it, they know better than you." (via [@LGBTplusBristol](https://twitter.com/lgbtplusbristol))
	
- ‚úÖ Ensuring your conference has easily accessible gender-neutral restrooms is a simple way to help non-binary and trans individuals feel included and welcome at your conference.**
    

### Toiletries/Supplies

-   üçé Provide tampons and pads in all restrooms (some people who identify as male have periods and may need them)
    

### üçé Dedicated rooms

-   The rooms should be clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, and their locations should be provided in both the print and the online conference directory and maps.
    
-   Don't allow anyone (even organizers) to use the room for other purposes.
    

#### üçé Nursing & Pumping Room

-   Ensure there is a dedicated, single-occupancy space with lock.
    
-   For the room to be optimally useful, these things are desired:

    -   Locking door
    
    -   Comfortable chair (ideally, with arms that do not have gaps between the armrest and the seat, and a set of firm cushions for positioning an infant)
    
	-   A desk or table next to the chair (to set the pump, bottles, etc. on), no more than 4 feet from the nearest electrical outlet
    
	-   Cleaning wipes, paper towels, and a garbage can for maintaining cleanliness
    
	-   Masking tape and a marker for labeling milk bottles and pump parts
    
	-   Close proximity to a sink for hand washing and washing of pump parts
    
	-   A refrigerator for storage of pumped milk (could be in the pumping room, or ideally accessible outside of the room but nearby)
    
	-   If possible, a dimmable light or a small lamp could be provided instead of bright overhead lighting
    

#### üçé Gender-Neutral Bottle Feeding Room

-   Bottle-fed babies can be fed by caregivers of any gender and also benefit from a quiet, low-distraction, private space for feeding.
    
-   This should be a separate, additional room ( NOT the same as the nursing and pumping room ). It could accommodate multiple babies at a time and be equipped with:
    
	-   Multiple comfortable chairs with broad armrests to facilitate bottle feeding positions
    
	-   A bottle warmer
    
	-   Paper towels, cleaning wipes and garbage can for cleanliness
    
	-   Dim lighting and in a quiet area of the conference center/venue
    
	-   Clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, though a locking door is not necessary
    

#### üçé Quiet Room

-   A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation of being surrounded by people at the conference.
    

	-   No phone calls, talking/socializing, etc.
    
	-   Put notifications on silent/vibrate.
    
	-   People whose religions require frequent prayer can make use of the quiet room.
    

-   Ideal is to provide one well-lit quiet room, and a second dimly-lit room.
    
-   Consider "quiet areas" if a separate room is not possible.
    

## Code of Conduct (CoC)

### Awareness

Make sure that everyone involved in your conference/event is aware that the CoC applies to them: that not only includes participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members etc.

-   üçé Tick box at registration that confirms that the participant has read it
    

	-   A pop-up with a short version may also be a good idea.
    
	-   Provide a link to the full ("less quick") version of the Code of Conduct, hosted on its own page.    

-   üçé Include a copy of the CoC in the sponsor packet
    
-   üçé Mention that the CoC applies to the speakers in the speaker guidelines
    
-   üçé Ensure that CoC is easily accessible on the conference website
    

	-   Should be in main navigation or in the footer (footer is a known pattern, near privacy policy / terms of service)
    
	-   Implement additional web-based highlights of the CoC via loading pages, pop-ups, screen savers, etc.
    

-   üçé Include a short version on the printed schedule as a reminder
    
-   üçé Mention it in the welcome talk and at the start of every day, including who to contact if there is a problem/violation
    

## Participant Selection

### Speakers

#### Invited Speakers
-   ‚úÖ Reach beyond the conference organizers' own networks. Take steps to go out and find people who might be lesser-known but would make great speakers. Look for more than just "the usual suspects" and reach out to your wider network for ideas, suggestions, and introductions.
    

#### CFP review ("blind" vs "affirmative action")

-   ‚úÖ Regardless of which approach you choose, open or anonymized, we encourage you to make it "double" so that both parties know each other (double-open) or neither party knows the other (double-closed)

-   üçé Consider the specific wording of how you solicit talks (subtlety can make a big difference)
    

	-   E.g. "Experts in best practices" may turn away people who don't self-identify as "expert" or who have impostor syndrome.
    
	-   "Speakers who have advice or expertise to share" > Everyone has some level of expertise or knowledge to share about what they work on, so this phrasing is more inclusive and inviting.
    

-   Ensure panels and roundtables include a diversity of participants
    

	-   Make strategic use of the moderator role to help support diverse participation
    

#### Selecting Speakers

-   üçé Call For Proposals (CFP) instructions
    

	-   In the solicitation, be transparent that you want a broad & diverse group to share their expertise.
    
	-   Let applicants know what criteria will be used to assess their submission and how speakers will be chosen.
    
	-   If possible, create detailed instructions and/or run workshops to help prepare people to write strong proposals.
    
	-   Be clear in who you want
    

		-   If your conference has a long history and you're trying to change what it's like, be up front about the kinds of people you want to have speak, why, and how this may look different from years past.
    

	-   Consider carefully the way you describe your event and the call for proposals in order to avoid turning away or self-de-selecting of potential speakers.
    

  

### Attracting Attendees

-   üçé Pay attention to the photos you use to advertise your event‚Äîwhat do people look like who attend?
    

  

### Event Registration

#### Preparing to meet accessibility needs

-   üçé Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
    

	-   "Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please email contact@myconference.com and include the details of your request."

#### Demographic Info

-   ‚úÖ If you do collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the questions so that they are inclusive and don't contribute to alienating or "othering" marginalized people.
    

	-   Not having an answer choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
    

-   ‚úÖ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for limiting access to this information and keeping it secure.
    

### Childcare

‚úÖ Offer financial support for childcare.

-   Build it into your budget.
    

	-   Link it to sponsorships, or university partners, or make part of the registration fee from all attendees go towards providing childcare support as service.
    
	-   Add an option to the registration, e.g.: "Donate $20 to help with childcare costs."
    
	-   Collect the data on the registration form. How many people would make use of childcare services or grants?
    

-   In general, the two major options are either to 1) award childcare grants (people decide how to spend it, e.g. on their home babysitter) or 2) provide on-site services. 

#### Dietary Restrictions

-   üçé Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.
    

#### Photo Policy

-   üçé If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out.
    

	-   (see lanyard/photography explanation under [Inclusive Practices](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/blob/master/inclusive_practices_during_checkin.md))
    

#### Code of Conduct

-   üçé Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.
    

### Catering

Making sure that your attendees have something they can eat at mealtimes is an important element of building an inclusive and welcoming conference.

-   Best to have a sign/small label in front of each dish with a list of ingredients and common labels (e.g. "gluten-free, vegan, includes peanuts").
    

	-   üçé Ask your caterer to create and provide the labels.
    

-   üçé Make sure to include a variety of beverages, in particular non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated.
-   ‚úÖ Common dietary needs to plan for:
    

	-   Gluten free
    
	-   Dairy free
    
	-   Vegan
    
	-   Vegetarian
    
	-   Pork free
    
	-   Shellfish free
    
	-   Soy free
    
	-   Nut free - especially peanut (this is usually a serious allergy so take extra care)
    
	-   Kosher
	    
	-   Halal
    

## Inclusive practices during check-in

#### üçé Photography Permissions

-   Managing photography opt-outs:
    

	-   Badge lanyard at registration should be made available to indicate photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos)
    

#### üçé Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons

-   Indicating pronouns:
    

	-   Select a pin/button/ribbon for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don't feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who do.
    
	-   Color-coordinate the pins by pronoun for quicker recognition and processing by those who see the pins. This lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color).
    

		-   Be sure to choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness. With color-coded pins, needing to actually read them is a stress case rather than the norm. Because people are used to the ease of the normal case, they're more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)
    
		-   To be aware of: Make pins large enough to be easily seen. Made the pronoun itself the largest text, rather than the word "Pronouns".
    

	-   Another option for pronoun indication is ribbons.
    

		-   Have custom ones printed for Zi/Zir and a "Fill in your own" ribbon. For fill in your own, make sure you provide fabric markers. (h/t @oxinabox)
    
### Grants/Scholarships

‚úÖ Offer grants to support attendance

-   Eligibility Requirements
    

	-   Applicants should be
    

		-   from a traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, indigenous, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities
    
		-   and be unable to attend without some financial assistance. (language adapted from [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/event/api-strategy-practice-conference-2017/diversity-scholarship/))
    

	-   Also consider providing support for applicants from developing economies.
    

		-   You might use the World Bank definitions of low and low-middle income. ([http://bit.ly/1nO82wD](http://bit.ly/1nO82wD))
    

	-   Your organizing committee should decide which career stages are eligible: Everyone? Just students and post-docs? Junior faculty/researchers? Unemployed?
    

-   The legal issues of specifically funding underrepresented groups varies by country.
    

	-   [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) deals with this by having a separate entity (the Galaxy Community Fund) offer sponsorships.
    

-   Payment
    

	-   Typically, recipients either submit receipts for reimbursement, have direct expenses paid for by the organizing committee, or are granted a lump sum up-front.
    
	-   We encourage conferences to pay for things directly rather than making attendees pay and wait to be reimbursed, or at least offer this as an option for people who want to use it.
    

		-   Waiting for reimbursement can be a financial burden on scholarship recipients.
