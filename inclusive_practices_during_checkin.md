## Inclusive practices during check-in

Pronouns

- üçé Via SRCCON: &quot;When you register, you can choose a badge lanyard indicating your photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) and a pin for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don&#39;t feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for the colleagues who do (and please respect other people&#39;s pronouns).&quot;
- &quot;One thing I&#39;d like to try next are pins+hack your own. the pins are also color coordinated, they&#39;re there to set a norm and officially sanction them. it lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color! + choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness) and means that needing to actually read is a stress case rather than the norm. and because people are used to the ease of normal case, they&#39;re more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)&quot; ~Cordelia Yu
- To be aware of: &quot;pins were also tiny (1/2 inch circles) with 60% taken up by the words &quot;pronouns&quot; and spacing.&quot;

Welcoming New Attendees

- Additional ribbons can be useful, e.g. &quot;First-Time Attendee.&quot; Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- Run a mentoring program

Social Events

- &quot;First-Time Attendee&quot; lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
- Host post-official-agenda receptions
- Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
  - Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
- Alcohol Considerations

- We recommend the AdaCamp Toolkit&#39;s summary approach to alcohol at events: [https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)
