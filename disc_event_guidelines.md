## The NumFOCUS DISC Guide to Diverse and Inclusive Conferences and Events

Produced by the NumFOCUS Diversity &amp; Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Program, with support from the Moore Foundation

## Introduction

### About this Guide:

This guide is intended as a resource for **organizers of conferences and events** ‚Äî with a particular focus on the tech sector in the United States ‚Äî to **support and encourage diversity and inclusion** at those events.

It focuses specifically on plans, decisions, and actions organizers can take to produce and manage a more diverse and inclusive event.

_Funding to produce this guide was made possible by a generous grant from the_ **Moore Foundation** _._

### What this Guide is not:

This guide is **not** intended to provide **general instructions** on how to run a successful conference or event. We do not provide any specific advice about budgeting, scheduling, A/V capabilities, how to structure tracks, etc.

Some &quot;basic&quot; best practice is understood to be a prerequisite for many of our recommendations. For example, live-captioning support for the hearing-impaired is not possible without reliable internet and good A/V setup. In general, we have avoided explicitly calling out these implied dependencies in order to maintain focus and keep the guide to a more manageable length.

### How to use this Guide:

You **do not have to implement every suggestion** in the guide in order to &quot;qualify&quot; as having a diverse and inclusive event!

The guide is intended to help you, as an event organizer, to understand the **overall landscape** of best practices for diversity and inclusion.

**We encourage you to do as much as you can manage** , on the understanding that implementing a few well-supported and fully realized suggestions is preferable to implementing many suggestions that are poorly-supported or incomplete.

To facilitate ease of use, we have highlighted suggestions that are **easy to implement** and which have a **strong positive impact**. These are &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; and marked with a red apple emoji: üçé.

We also encourage you to do **at least one thing** in the &quot;High Impact, High Effort&quot; quadrant. These are marked with a green checkmark: ‚úÖ.

### Organizing Committee

- ‚úÖ The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity you want to create in your conference!
- Prioritizing diversity starts with you.

### Venue Selection &amp; On-Site Services

Accessibility Considerations

- Consider attendees who may need accommodations for a disability
-
‚óè‚óè

Mobility

- üçé Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair, crutches, cane, etc.)
- Reduce conference sprawl to support access for the mobility-impaired
- Consider making remote access available via livestream, recorded talks, etc.
- Make sure the building is wheelchair accessible. (In U.S. this is typically required by law.)
- Be aware of how far/near the closest wheelchair-accessible restrooms are.

Disability

- ‚úÖ Potentially book sign-language interpreters and/or real-time captioning (someone typing captions) for deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees
- Consider using patterns rather than just color to indicate differences, to make comprehension easier for attendees with color blindness/low vision issues
- üçé Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps
  - Include maps in advance, with the schedule

Bathrooms

Gender-Neutral Bathrooms

- Ideally you would provide 3 restrooms: gender-neutral, female, male
- ‚úÖ Ensuring your conference has easily accessible gender-neutral restrooms is the best way to ensure that non-binary and trans individuals feel included and welcome at your conference.
- How to re-label bathrooms if the venue signs are traditional &quot;men&#39;s&quot; and &quot;women&#39;s&quot; rooms?
  - &quot;With Urinals&quot; / &quot;Without Urinals&quot;
  - &quot;All Gender Restroom&quot;
  - &quot;No Assumptions. No Gender Roles. Just Toilets.&quot;
- üçé Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing what to do if you think someone is in the &quot;wrong&quot; restroom
  - &quot;If you think someone&#39;s gender doesn&#39;t match the sign on the door, please follow these steps: Don&#39;t worry about it, they know better than you.&quot; (via @LGBTplusBristol)

Toiletries/Supplies

- üçé Provide tampons and pads in all restrooms (some people who identify as male have periods and may need them)

Dedicated rooms

üçé Nursing, Pumping &amp; Bottle Feeding Rooms

The rooms should be clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, and their locations should be provided in both the print and the online conference directory.

- üçé Ensure there is a dedicated, single-occupancy space with lock.
- üçé Don&#39;t allow anyone (even organizers) to use the room for other purposes.
- For the room to be optimally useful, these things are desired:
  - Locking door
  - Comfortable chair (ideally, with arms that do not have gaps between the armrest and the seat, and a set of firm cushions for positioning an infant)
  - A desk or table next to the chair (to set the pump, bottles, etc on), no more than 4 feet from the nearest electrical outlet
  - Cleaning wipes, paper towels, and a garbage pail for maintaining cleanliness
  - Masking tape and a marker for labeling milk bottles and pump parts
  - Close proximity to a sink for hand washing and washing of pump parts
  - A refrigerator for storage of pumped milk (could be in the pumping room, or ideally accessible outside of the room, but nearby)
  - If possible, a dimmable light, or a small lamp could be provided instead of bright overhead lighting
- Gender-neutral bottle feeding room
  - Bottle-fed babies can be fed by caregivers of any gender, and also benefit from a quiet, low-distraction, private space for feeding.
  - This should be a separate, additional room ( **NOT the same as the nursing and pumping room** ). It could accommodate multiple babies at a time and be equipped with:
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Multiple comfortable chairs with broad armrests to facilitate bottle feeding positions
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†A bottle warmer
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Paper towels, cleaning wipes and garbage pail for cleanliness
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Dim lighting and in a quiet area of the conference center
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, though a locking door is not necessary

üçé Quiet Room

- A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation of being surrounded by people at the conference.
  - No phone calls, talking/socializing, etc.
  - Put notifications on silent/vibrate.
  - People whose religions require frequent prayer can make use of the quiet room.

### Catering

Catering Requirements

- ‚úÖ Common dietary needs to plan for:
  - Gluten free
  - Dairy free
  - Vegan
  - Vegetarian
  - Pork free
  - Shellfish free
  - Soy free
  - Nut free - esp. peanut (this is usually a serious allergy so take extra care)
  - Kosher
  - Halal
- Best to have a label in front of each dish with a list of ingredients and common labels (e.g. &quot;gluten-free, vegan, includes peanuts&quot;).
  - üçé Ask your caterer to create and provide the labels.
- üçé Make sure to include a variety of beverages, in particular non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated.

### Childcare

- ‚úÖ Offer financial support for childcare.
  - Build it into your budget; link to sponsorships OR university partners OR part of conference registration fee from all attendees goes towards providing this as service, add an option to the registration, &quot;Donate $20 to help with childcare costs.&quot;
  - Collect the data on the registration form - how many people would make use of childcare services or grants?
- The two general options are either to award childcare grants (people decide how to spend it, e.g. on their home babysitter) or provide on-site services
  - Grants seem to be more popular with attendees
    -

[ANNOTATION:

BY &#39;Gina Helfrich&#39;
ON &#39;2017-11-30T17:31:37&#39;
NOTE: &#39;resolve this.&#39;]
Then the trick is: application &amp; vetting process for determining need
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Do you have to submit an invoice or receipt from someone with a Tax ID?
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†I.e. how to prevent fraud, provide useful service
- On-site services can be costly because of additional travel costs for bringing children along.  For those who do bring kids:
  - Cost-free access to the conference center for child caregivers
  - This allows caregivers to come to the conference for infant hand-offs (e.g. for nursing) as opposed to parents losing additional time walking back to hotel rooms.

On-Site Childcare Services

- There are companies that provide childcare at conferences (we can provide the list; make no specific endorsements)
  - Corporate Kids Events: [https://conferencechildcare.com/](https://conferencechildcare.com/)
  - American Child Care, Inc.: [http://www.americanchildcare.com/conventions.htm](http://www.americanchildcare.com/conventions.htm)
  - Kiddie Corp: [http://www.kiddiecorp.com/](http://www.kiddiecorp.com/)
  - Urbansitter: [https://www.urbansitter.com/](https://www.urbansitter.com/)
  - Care.com: [https://www.care.com/](https://www.care.com/)
  - Accent: [http://www.accentoca.com/](http://www.accentoca.com/)
  - Etc.
- Could organize a &quot;Parallel&quot; conference for older children
  - E.g. coding for kids

### Code of Conduct (CoC)

[**Code of Conduct**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mtxLq0e9TPqcWtCikql6hd_Pva2hfu35yjtrB0PdiM/edit) **(Reshama&#39;s notes)**

Awareness

- Make sure that **everyone involved in your conference/event** is aware that the CoC applies to them: that not only includes participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members etc.
  - üçé Tick box at registration that reinforces the fact that the participant has read it (a pop-up with a short version may also be a good idea - that way folks get the broad idea but do not need to read through it in detail)
  - üçé Include a copy in a sponsor packet
  - üçé You could also mention that CoC applies to the speakers in the speaker guidelines
- üçé Ensure that CoC is **easily** accessible on the conference website
  - Should be in main navigation or in the footer (footer is a known pattern, near privacy policy / terms of service)
- üçé Include a short version on the printed schedule as a reminder
- üçé Mention it in welcome talk and start of every day

-
  - Mention who to contact if there is a problem/violation
- If you send out daily event e-mails, include an item on &quot;Seeing or experiencing something that makes you uncomfortable&quot;
  - Remember that you can always speak to one of our ombudspersons about any matter of concern, no matter how small.
- Include short blurbs about CoC during breaks (e.g. during slide breaks), on websites etc. A good example includes a little Slack message shown when booting up
- Consider a visual &quot;workflow&quot; of CoC violation:
  - Report -&gt; Action -&gt; Resolution
- Make it clear what the consequences or resolutions of a violation are

Reporting

- Make sure that people are aware of reporting mechanisms:
  - Face to face with staff (is there a dedicated person - ombuds)
  - Email to conduct@
  - Fill out an online form
- Ensure confidentiality of person who is reporting the violation (and the violator); as well as ensure that the data is stored securely with limited access

Enforcement

- Be clear on how long it will take to resolve the situation or take an action on the violation
- If you have a process for recording a CoC violation, ensure that the data are stored securely and that everyone&#39;s identities are protected. Access to the data should be limited.
- \*\*Discuss: having a process for recording a CoC violation
- When possible, have a third party to review violation report
- Encourage positive behavior (as opposed to &quot;Don&#39;t do this‚Ä¶..&quot; but &quot;Do this‚Ä¶.&quot;)
- Include list of FAQs

### Grants/Scholarships

Why funding is important

- Registration vs. Travel &amp; Lodging
  - Most [PyData](http://www.pydata.org) Diversity Scholarship attendees indicated that receiving funding to cover registration was make-or-break for their ability to attend. Sometimes those who didn&#39;t have additional funding for travel &amp; lodging were unable to attend even though their registration was covered.
  - Interest in [Galaxy fellowships](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2017-03-gcc2017-fellowships/) went up when added covering the first $n of travel costs as well.

‚úÖ Offer grants to support attendance

- Eligibility Requirements
  - Applicants should be from a traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities; and be unable to attend without some financial assistance.&quot; (language adapted from [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/event/api-strategy-practice-conference-2017/diversity-scholarship/))
  - Can also consider support for applicants from developing economies.  Use the World Bank definitions of low and low-middle income. ( [http://bit.ly/1nO82wD](http://bit.ly/1nO82wD))
  - Can also support indigenous populations.  Could not find an agreed upon list of indigenous groups.
  - Need to decide what career stages are eligible.  Just students and post-docs.  Junior faculty/researchers?  Unemployed?
  - The legal issues of specifically funding underrepresented groups varies by country.
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Galaxy deals with this by having a separate entity (the Galaxy Community Fund) offer sponsorships.
- Payment
  - Cut a check or submit receipts for reimbursement.
  - Try hard to pay for things directly rather than making attendees pay and wait to be reimbursed, or at least offer this as an option for people who want to use it.

Where to seek funding

- How to attract funding?
  - Consider posting an opportunity for attendees or community members to make individual donations in support of travel scholarships.
  - Make corporate sponsor levels specifically tied to travel/lodging and/or registration scholarships.
  - Run a crowdfunding campaign to support particular inclusion efforts (e.g. childcare expenses ‚Äî Open Source Bridge did this.)
  - Dedicate surpluses from previous events to funding fellowships.
- Possible Funding Sources (needs more research)
  - Moore Foundation
  - Sloan Foundation
  - Python Software Foundation
  - NumFOCUS Foundation
  - Arnold Foundation
  - Helmsley Foundation
  - Chan-Zuckerburg Foundation
  - PyLadies
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Gives scholarships to PyCon participants

### Participant Selection

Speakers

Invited Speakers

- ‚úÖ Expand conference organizers&#39; networks to go out and find people who might fit the bill but be lesser-known ‚Äî personal recommendations, look for more than just &quot;the usual suspects&quot;
- Identify a group of people to solicit as conference speakers
  - Embrace quotas to ensure a diverse speaker pool
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Make list of potential speakers who are underrepresented longer than list of usual suspects (e.g. ‚Äî have a longer list of women than men), so when someone declines or drops out you can just move to the next one on the list
  - Keep and maintain a list of people with expertise and their contact info
  - Expand networks, talk to people directly
  - &quot;If your system is to have speakers come to you &amp; ask, but research shows they tend not to do so, they won&#39;t come.&quot;
- üçé Consider the specific wording of how you solicit talks (subtlety can make a big difference)
  - E.g. &quot;Experts in best practices&quot; may turn away people who don&#39;t self-identify as &quot;expert&quot; or who have impostor syndrome
  - &quot;Speakers who have advice or expertise to share&quot; &gt; everyone has some level of expertise or knowledge to share about what they work on
- Ensure panels and roundtables include diversity of participants
  - Make strategic use of moderator role to help support diverse participation

Selected Speakers

- üçé Call For Proposals (CFP) instructions
  - In the solicitation, be transparent that you want a broad &amp; diverse group to share their expertise.
  - Let applicants know what criteria will be used to assess their submission and how speakers will be chosen.
  - If possible, create detailed instructions and/or run workshops to help prepare people to write strong proposals.
- ‚úÖ CFP review (&quot;blind&quot; vs &quot;affirmative action&quot;)
  - [Double-Blind vs Single-Blind Review](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/07/new-study-suggests-continued-bias-academic-conference-panel-selections)
  - &quot;Blind&quot; Review
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†By changing speaker selection to completely &quot;blind,&quot; you may be able to increase representation from traditionally underrepresented groups.
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†You might create a CFP form that instructs the submitter to withhold identifying information.
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†You can assign 1-2 people to remove the identifying information from submissions before passing them to the next group of reviewers/assessing team.
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†If you recognize a submission author and you&#39;re on the review committee, do not grade the submission (recuse yourself).
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Optionally, the review team can de-anonymize after the review process to ensure that the final selection is representative of the diverse grouping that we want.
  - Double Open Review
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Reviewers know who the proposal authors are and proposal authors know who the reviewers are
    - ‚ñ†‚ñ†Sample guidelines for reviewers in double open review systems: [https://scipy2017.scipy.org/ehome/220975/532468/](https://scipy2017.scipy.org/ehome/220975/532468/)
- Be clear in who you want
  - If your conference has a long history and you&#39;re trying to change what it&#39;s like, be up front about the kinds of people you want to have speak, why, and how this may look different from years past
  - Consider carefully the way you describe your event and the call for proposals in order to avoid turning away or self-de-selecting of potential speakers
- Offer speaker training
  - Let potential speakers know there are resources to help them prepare, and provide them.
  - Does the content of your talk abide by the code of conduct?
  - Consider live-streaming or recording your talk
  - Can the conference help with close captioning a video of your talk?
  - Consider color-blindness in slide design
  - Provide handouts of slides and/or transcripts (both large and small format)
  - Verbally describe graphs and illustrations

Incentivize First-Time Speakers:

- E.g. &quot;We are looking to diversify our speaker panel; we want to ensure that we select a cohort of first-time speakers to ensure we continue to offer professional development opportunities to everyone in the community.&quot;

Attracting Attendees

- Advertise the Code of Conduct to convey that you are seeking an inclusive environment
- Be clear about what your event is about, explain it to people who are less familiar and haven&#39;t attended before
- üçé Pay attention to the photos you use to advertise your event‚Äîwhat do people look like who attend?

### Event Registration

What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

Preparing to meet accessibility needs

- Outline any accessibility services you plan to provide on the registration form. Then:
- üçé Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
  - &quot;Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please email [contact@myconference.com](mailto:contact@myconference.com) and include the details of your request.&quot;
- Provide any deadlines for requests (it can be difficult to arrange sign-language translation at the last minute, for example).

Supporting Attendance through Grants

- &quot;Would you be interested in a grant to cover childcare OR on-site childcare services? (Which would be most beneficial?)&quot;

Dietary Restrictions

- üçé Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.
- Use an open text box to ask about dietary restrictions.
  - &quot;Do you have any dietary restrictions we should be aware of? (e.g. allergies)&quot;

Photo Policy

- üçé If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out.
  - (see lanyard photo explanation under Inclusive Practices)


**Further reading:**

- Geek Feminism Photography [http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Photography](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Photography)

Code of Conduct

- üçé Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

T-Shirts

- If you plan to offer t-shirts, consider offering more than one cut/fit of shirt.
- Provide shirt sizing information with the registration form where you ask for shirt size. (Provide a wide range of sizes, including plus-size.)
- Describe the cut in gender-neutral terms (e.g. &quot;fitted&quot; vs. &quot;straight-cut&quot;) with photo examples, rather than using gender-loaded terms (&quot;men&#39;s,&quot; &quot;women&#39;s,&quot; &quot;unisex&quot;).

Demographic Info

- **Why do you need it?**
  - We recommend you do not ask for information just &quot;out of curiosity&quot; but rather that there are **planned actions you will take depending on the results** of your survey.
  - If just for purposes of &quot;counting&quot; or ascertaining the diversity of your conference, we suggest doing this in the form of an anonymous post-survey instead.
- If you absolutely must include demographic info in your registration form, **make it optional, not required**. Forcing people to identify themselves by demographic category is not an inclusive practice and may prompt stereotype threat.
- ‚úÖ If you do collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the questions so that they are inclusive and don&#39;t contribute to alienating or &quot;othering&quot; marginalized people.
  - Not having an answer choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
- ‚úÖ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for limiting access to this information and keeping it secure.

Inclusive practices during check-in

Pronouns

- üçé Via SRCCON: &quot;When you register, you can choose a badge lanyard indicating your photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) and a pin for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don&#39;t feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for the colleagues who do (and please respect other people&#39;s pronouns).&quot;
- &quot;One thing I&#39;d like to try next are pins+hack your own. the pins are also color coordinated, they&#39;re there to set a norm and officially sanction them. it lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color! + choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness) and means that needing to actually read is a stress case rather than the norm. and because people are used to the ease of normal case, they&#39;re more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)&quot; ~Cordelia Yu
- To be aware of: &quot;pins were also tiny (1/2 inch circles) with 60% taken up by the words &quot;pronouns&quot; and spacing.&quot;

Welcoming New Attendees

- Additional ribbons can be useful, e.g. &quot;First-Time Attendee.&quot; Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- Run a mentoring program

Social Events

- &quot;First-Time Attendee&quot; lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
- Host post-official-agenda receptions
- Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
  - Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
- Alcohol Considerations

- We recommend the AdaCamp Toolkit&#39;s summary approach to alcohol at events: [https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)

Special Considerations Depending on Geographic Context

E.g. very remote location with no public transit

U.S.-specific information vs. other countries (e.g. ADA protections)

 States with discriminatory laws (Needs info)
