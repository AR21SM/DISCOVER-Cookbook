## The NumFOCUS DISC Guide to Diverse and Inclusive Conferences and Events

Produced by the NumFOCUS Diversity &amp; Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Program, with support from the Moore Foundation

## Introduction

### About this Guide:

This guide is intended as a resource for **organizers of conferences and events** — with a particular focus on the tech sector in the United States — to **support and encourage diversity and inclusion** at those events.

It focuses specifically on plans, decisions, and actions organizers can take to produce and manage a more diverse and inclusive event.

_Funding to produce this guide was made possible by a generous grant from the_ **Moore Foundation** _._

### What this Guide is not:

This guide is **not** intended to provide **general instructions** on how to run a successful conference or event. We do not provide any specific advice about budgeting, scheduling, A/V capabilities, how to structure tracks, etc.

Some &quot;basic&quot; best practice is understood to be a prerequisite for many of our recommendations. For example, live-captioning support for the hearing-impaired is not possible without reliable internet and good A/V setup. In general, we have avoided explicitly calling out these implied dependencies in order to maintain focus and keep the guide to a more manageable length.

### How to use this Guide:

You **do not have to implement every suggestion** in the guide in order to &quot;qualify&quot; as having a diverse and inclusive event!

The guide is intended to help you, as an event organizer, to understand the **overall landscape** of best practices for diversity and inclusion.

**We encourage you to do as much as you can manage** , on the understanding that implementing a few well-supported and fully realized suggestions is preferable to implementing many suggestions that are poorly-supported or incomplete.

To facilitate ease of use, we have highlighted suggestions that are **easy to implement** and which have a **strong positive impact**. These are &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; and marked with a red apple emoji: 🍎.

We also encourage you to do **at least one thing** in the &quot;High Impact, High Effort&quot; quadrant. These are marked with a green checkmark: ✅.
