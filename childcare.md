### Childcare

- ✅ Offer financial support for childcare.
  - Build it into your budget; link to sponsorships OR university partners OR part of conference registration fee from all attendees goes towards providing this as service, add an option to the registration, &quot;Donate $20 to help with childcare costs.&quot;
  - Collect the data on the registration form - how many people would make use of childcare services or grants?
- The two general options are either to award childcare grants (people decide how to spend it, e.g. on their home babysitter) or provide on-site services
  - Grants seem to be more popular with attendees

- On-site services can be costly because of additional travel costs for bringing children along.  For those who do bring kids:
  - Cost-free access to the conference center for child caregivers
  - This allows caregivers to come to the conference for infant hand-offs (e.g. for nursing) as opposed to parents losing additional time walking back to hotel rooms.
