## How to use this cookbook
---

You **do not have to implement every suggestion** in the cookbook in order to &quot;qualify&quot; as having a diverse and inclusive event!

The cookbook is intended to help you, as an event organizer, to understand the **overall landscape** of best practices for diversity and inclusion.

**We encourage you to do as much as you can manage**, on the understanding that implementing a few well-supported and fully realized suggestions is preferable to implementing many suggestions that are poorly-supported or incomplete.

To facilitate ease of use, we have highlighted suggestions that are relatively **easy to implement** and which have a **strong positive impact**. These are &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; and marked with a red apple emoji: üçé.

We also encourage you to do **at least one thing** in the &quot;High Impact, High Effort&quot; quadrant. These are marked with a green checkmark: ‚úÖ.
