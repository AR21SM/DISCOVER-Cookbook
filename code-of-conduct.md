# Code of Conduct (CoC)

[**Code of Conduct**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-mtxLq0e9TPqcWtCikql6hd_Pva2hfu35yjtrB0PdiM/edit)

## Goals

A Code of Conduct should:
- Be easy to read (You shouldn't need a law degree to understand it.)
- Be easy to find
- Explain how to report problematic or unethical behavior	
- Explain the consequences of violating Code of Conduct provisions
- Include timelines/deadlines for action that will be taken

Additional Helpful Options to Support your Code of Conduct:
- Include FAQs
- Encourage positive behavior (don't just discourage negative behavior)
- Have a "quick read" version and a "less quick" version (e.g. http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html)
- Implement additional web-based highlights of the CoC via loading pages, pop-ups, screen savers, etc.

## Awareness

- Make sure that **everyone involved in your conference/event** is aware that the CoC applies to them: that not only includes participants, but also speakers, sponsors, committee members etc.
  - üçé Tick box at registration that confirms that the participant has read it
      - A pop-up with a short version may also be a good idea.
      - Provide a link to the full ("less quick") version of the Code of Conduct, hosted on its own page.
  - üçé Include a copy of the CoC in the sponsor packet
  - üçé Mention that the oC applies to the speakers in the speaker guidelines
- üçé Ensure that CoC is **easily** accessible on the conference website
  - Should be in main navigation or in the footer (footer is a known pattern, near privacy policy / terms of service)
- üçé Include a short version on the printed schedule as a reminder
- üçé Mention it in the welcome talk and at the start of every day, including who to contact if there is a problem/violation
- If you send out daily event e-mails, include an item on &quot;Seeing or experiencing something that makes you uncomfortable&quot;
  - &quot;Remember that you can always speak to one of our ombudspersons about any matter of concern, no matter how small.&quot;
- Include short blurbs about the CoC during breaks (e.g. during slide breaks), on websites, etc. 
  - For example, the Slack app shows little messages when booting up, which is a great time to highlight something like the CoC.
- Consider a visual &quot;workflow&quot; of CoC violation:
  - Report -&gt; Action -&gt; Resolution
- Make it clear what the consequences or resolutions of a violation are

## Reporting

- Make sure that people are aware of reporting mechanisms:
  - Face to face with staff (is there a dedicated person - ombuds)
  - Email to conduct@
  - Fill out an online form
- Ensure confidentiality of person who is reporting the violation (and the violator); as well as ensure that the data is stored securely with limited access

## Enforcement

- Be clear on how long it will take to resolve the situation or take an action on the violation
- If you have a process for recording a CoC violation, ensure that the data are stored securely and that everyone&#39;s identities are protected. Access to the data should be limited.
- Discuss: having a process for recording a CoC violation
- When possible, have a third party to review violation report
- Encourage positive behavior (as opposed to &quot;Don&#39;t do this‚Ä¶..&quot; but &quot;Do this‚Ä¶.&quot;)
- Include list of FAQs
