### Grants/Scholarships

Why funding is important

- Registration vs. Travel &amp; Lodging
  - Most [PyData](http://www.pydata.org) Diversity Scholarship attendees indicated that receiving funding to cover registration was make-or-break for their ability to attend. Sometimes those who didn&#39;t have additional funding for travel &amp; lodging were unable to attend even though their registration was covered.
  - Interest in [Galaxy fellowships](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2017-03-gcc2017-fellowships/) went up when added covering the first $n of travel costs as well.

✅ Offer grants to support attendance

- Eligibility Requirements
  - Applicants should be from a traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities; and be unable to attend without some financial assistance.&quot; (language adapted from [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/event/api-strategy-practice-conference-2017/diversity-scholarship/))
  - Can also consider support for applicants from developing economies.  Use the World Bank definitions of low and low-middle income. ( [http://bit.ly/1nO82wD](http://bit.ly/1nO82wD))
  - Can also support indigenous populations.  Could not find an agreed upon list of indigenous groups.
  - Need to decide what career stages are eligible.  Just students and post-docs.  Junior faculty/researchers?  Unemployed?
  - The legal issues of specifically funding underrepresented groups varies by country.
    - ■■Galaxy deals with this by having a separate entity (the Galaxy Community Fund) offer sponsorships.
- Payment
  - Cut a check or submit receipts for reimbursement.
  - Try hard to pay for things directly rather than making attendees pay and wait to be reimbursed, or at least offer this as an option for people who want to use it.

Where to seek funding
